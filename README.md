# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment



-------------------------------------------

### Experience building this project

During my internship at Fendahl International from March to April 2023, I had the invaluable opportunity to work on impactful projects that significantly contributed to my growth as a Software Development Engineer. One of the projects that I took the lead on was a news application, which I consider a defining experience in my journey.

The news application project allowed me to apply my skills in React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Material-UI (MUI) to create a feature-rich and user-friendly web application. From the initial stages, where the project was centered around displaying news articles, to the final product, where users could not only access news but also filter through categories for a tailored experience, the journey was characterized by continuous improvement and adaptability.

The challenges I encountered during this project were numerous and diverse. One of the most notable aspects was the utilization of local storage concepts to ensure that users' preferences and settings were retained across sessions. This required a deep understanding of browser storage mechanisms and an ability to implement efficient data handling procedures.

Throughout the internship, the project's requirements evolved, prompting me to frequently adapt my approach and strategies. I learned the importance of effective communication, as I collaborated closely with my mentors to understand changing expectations and incorporate new features seamlessly.

The experience at Fendahl International extended beyond technical aspects. I grasped the significance of project management, time allocation, and the significance of delivering on time. I also imbibed the essence of teamwork and learned to thrive in a collaborative environment where ideas and suggestions were freely shared, ultimately leading to a more polished end product.

By the conclusion of my internship, the news application project had transformed into a comprehensive platform, serving as a testament to my determination, adaptability, and technical skills. This experience has laid a solid foundation for my future endeavors, instilling in me the confidence to take on new challenges and deliver results that align with the high standards I set for myself.

Overall, my internship at Fendahl International was a transformative experience that not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also provided me with a holistic understanding of the software development life cycle and the dynamics of working within a professional team.
